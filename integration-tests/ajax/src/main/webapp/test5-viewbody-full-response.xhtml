    <h1>View Body replacement in Full Page Response</h1>

    <h2>
        Normally we only get a subset of a page, however it is theoretically
        possible to send a full page and replace only the head or body instead
        of just the entire page. (This is a possible corner condition of the protocol)
        Not sure if this is ever used but nevertheless the codebase has react to this condition.
