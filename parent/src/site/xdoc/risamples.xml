        <section name="Steps to get Sun's cardemo sample running">
            <ol>
                <li>Download the latest JSF Reference Implementation <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/javaserverfaces/download.html">here</a></li>
                <li>In samples dir you will find the cardemo web application archive named jsf-cardemo.war</li>
                <li>Unpack jsf-cardemo.war to a directory of your choice. If you are not familiar with deploying web applications and you are using tomcat, unpack jsf-cardemo.war to CATALINA_HOME/webapps/cardemo directory (where CATALINA_HOME = Tomcat installation directory)</li>
                <li>Remove all jar files from WEB-INF/lib directory but NOT! demo-components.jar</li>
                <li>Copy all jar files from simple.war or blank.war (the MyFaces examples, see getting started) to WEB-INF/lib directory</li>
                <li>Replace WEB-INF/web.xml with <a href="cardemoweb.html">web.xml</a></li>
                <li>Deploy web application. If you unpacked cardemo.war into CATALINA_HOME/webapps/cardemo start tomcat and see cardemo running at http://localhost:8080/cardemo</li>
