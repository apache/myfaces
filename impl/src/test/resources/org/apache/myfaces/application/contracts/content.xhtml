<!-- This page test what happen when a template that comes from
a resource library contract is defined in another template that is used
for views with different contracts. The algorithm that comes from old
facelets 1.1.x cache the urls of the templates, causing in this case
to use the wrong template file. The code should always check if the result
comes from ResourceHandler.createViewResource() and if that so, don't cache
that part, otherwise it is ok to cache it. -->
