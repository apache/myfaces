/**
* Changes to the downstream tsconfig
* for the myfaces build integration.
* key requirement no github dependencies on code level
* we have to compile mona-dish in directly on source level
* The idea is to copy all the needed files from the node
* dependencies into the source tree whenever we update the codebase
* and then build locally.
* Theoretically a build from the node folders would suffice.
* The end result is the same as well as in the mapping files
* but that would mean we do host the typescript code ourselves.
*
* That however means we have to upstream the code into the
* jsf_ts github project for the time being to be in sync with it.
