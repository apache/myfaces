	<ol>
		<li>The component should have dynamically created a HtmlDataTable</li>
		<li>
			The 'dynamic creation' code has subtle similarities to the 're-use same component on each row' code within HtmlDataTable. Specifically
			if the 'dynamic creation' code is hooking in to 'setParent' then it might get triggered by HtmlDataTable
		</li>
		<li>Click 'POSTback'. There should be no error</li>
