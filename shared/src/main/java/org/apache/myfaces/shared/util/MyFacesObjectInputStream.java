/**
 * Tried to deploy v0.4.2 on JBoss 3.2.1 and had a classloading problem again.
 * The problem seemed to be with JspInfo, line 98. We are using an
 * ObjectInputStream Class, which then cannot find the classes to deserialize
 * the input stream.  The solution appears to be to subclass ObjectInputStream
 * (eg. CustomInputStream), and specify a different class-loading mechanism.
